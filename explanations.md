# Component Explanations and Architecture

This document provides an explanation of the key components in the Tailwind CSS Interactive Learning Platform, their roles, how they interact, and considerations for their scalability and reusability.

## Core Learning Components

These components form the heart of the interactive learning experience.

### 1. `LearningInterface`

*   **File:** `components/learning/learning-interface.tsx`
*   **Role:** This is the main orchestrator for a lesson. It fetches the relevant lesson data from `lib/curriculum.ts` based on `moduleId` and `lessonId` props. It manages the state of `appliedClasses` (the Tailwind classes the user has entered) and `currentInput` (the class currently being typed). Handles `target_classes_to_remove` logic from lessons when new classes are added.
*   **Key Props:**
    *   `moduleId: string`: The ID of the current module.
    *   `lessonId: string`: The ID of the current lesson.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Renders `InstructionPanel`, `LivePreview`, and `CodeInputPanel`.
    *   Passes lesson data and `appliedClasses` to these children.
    *   Provides handlers (`handleClassAdd`, `handleClassRemove`, `handleReset`) to `CodeInputPanel` to update its state.
*   **Scalability & Reusability:**
    *   Currently designed specifically for this three-panel learning layout.
    *   Scalability for more complex lessons largely depends on the scalability of its child components, especially `LivePreview`.
    *   The logic for fetching and providing lesson data is straightforward. If the curriculum source changed (e.g., to an API), this component would be the place to update that logic.

### 2. `LivePreview`

*   **File:** `components/learning/live-preview.tsx`
*   **Role:** Displays the visual output of the user's work. It renders the HTML structure for the current lesson (either from `lesson.starter_component_jsx` or a fallback based on `lesson.component`) and applies the `appliedClasses` to it. It also includes viewport controls (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile) to allow users to see their work at different screen sizes.
*   **Key Props:**
    *   `appliedClasses: string[]`: The list of Tailwind classes to apply.
    *   `component: string`: Fallback component type (e.g., "div", "p", "button") if `starter_component_jsx` is not provided.
    *   `starter_component_jsx?: string`: The HTML string defining the initial structure for the lesson.
    *   `target_classes_applied_to_selector?: string`: (Optional) Allows lessons to specify a CSS selector for applying user classes to a specific element within the `starter_component_jsx`.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Receives `appliedClasses` and lesson structure details from `LearningInterface`.
    *   Uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render `starter_component_jsx`.
    *   Uses `useEffect` to dynamically apply classes to the correct target element based on `starter_component_jsx` and `target_classes_applied_to_selector`.
*   **Scalability & Reusability:**
    *   The introduction of `starter_component_jsx` and `target_classes_applied_to_selector` makes it more flexible for complex lessons.
    *   The `target_classes_applied_to_selector` is a first step. More complex scenarios (multiple targets, robust error handling for selectors) are noted in `considerations.md`.
    *   The viewport switching is a good reusable feature.
    *   If element targeting is further improved, it could be a very reusable component for any live HTML/CSS previewing tool.

### 3. `InstructionPanel`

*   **File:** `components/learning/instruction-panel.tsx`
*   **Role:** Displays rich lesson details from the new curriculum structure, including main/secondary titles, difficulty, focus concept, detailed multi-part explanations (intro, class details, key takeaway, expert tip), and hints. It also contains the "Next Step" button, which is enabled based on whether the `targetClasses` are met (basic validation).
*   **Key Props:**
    *   `lesson: Lesson`: An object containing all details for the current lesson (now reflecting the new richer structure).
    *   `appliedClasses: string[]`: Used to determine if the lesson is complete.
    *   `onNext: () => void`: Callback for when the "Next Step" button is clicked.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Receives lesson data from `LearningInterface`.
*   **Scalability & Reusability:**
    *   Quite scalable for displaying more lesson-related information. New fields from the `lesson` object can be easily added.
    *   The `isComplete` validation logic is currently very simple and only works for flat `targetClasses` arrays. This needs significant enhancement for complex lessons (see `considerations.md` - "Validation Logic for Complex Lesson Targets").
    *   Could be reused in various instructional or step-by-step guide UIs.

### 4. `CodeInputPanel`

*   **File:** `components/learning/code-input-panel.tsx`
*   **Role:** Provides the user interface for inputting Tailwind CSS classes. It shows currently applied classes (which can be removed) and offers static autocomplete suggestions. It also has a (currently placeholder) "Show Generated CSS" feature and a reset button.
*   **Key Props:**
    *   `currentInput: string`: The class string currently being typed.
    *   `setCurrentInput: (value: string) => void`: Callback to update `currentInput`.
    *   `appliedClasses: string[]`: List of currently active classes.
    *   `onClassAdd: (className: string) => void`: Callback when a class is submitted.
    *   `onClassRemove: (className: string) => void`: Callback when a class is removed.
    *   `onReset: () => void`: Callback for the reset button.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Manages its own state for input and suggestions.
    *   Communicates with `LearningInterface` to update the shared `appliedClasses` state.
*   **Scalability & Reusability:**
    *   The suggestion system is basic (static list) and could be improved to be context-aware (based on `lesson.learnings` or `lesson.component`).
    *   The "Show Generated CSS" feature is a placeholder and would require a Tailwind CSS compilation step (either client-side or server-side) to be functional.
    *   The core input and class management logic is fairly reusable for scenarios where users need to input and manage a list of string tokens.

## UI Components and Theming

### `components/ui/`

*   **Role:** This directory contains reusable UI elements like `Button`, `Card`, `Badge`, `Input`, etc. These are likely based on the [Shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) library, which provides accessible and stylable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Scalability & Reusability:**
    *   Highly reusable across the entire application. Using a component library like Shadcn/UI promotes consistency and accelerates development.
    *   Scalability is generally good, as these are well-tested components.

### `ThemeProvider`

*   **File:** `components/theme-provider.tsx`
*   **Role:** Wraps the application to provide theme switching capabilities (e.g., light/dark mode). It likely uses the `next-themes` library.
*   **Scalability & Reusability:**
    *   Standard and essential for theme management in Next.js applications. Highly reusable.
    *   Customization of themes is typically done via CSS variables defined in global stylesheets, which Tailwind CSS then uses.

## Page Structure and Routing

### Lesson Page (`app/learn/[moduleId]/[levelId]/page.tsx`)

*   **File:** `app/learn/[moduleId]/[levelId]/page.tsx`
    *   **Important Note:** The directory is named `[levelId]`, but the code within this page and `LearningInterface` expects a parameter named `lessonId`. This is a discrepancy that should be resolved by renaming the directory to `[lessonId]` for consistency and clarity.
*   **Role:** This is the dynamic Next.js page component responsible for rendering a specific lesson. It extracts `moduleId` and `levelId` (which is treated as `lessonId`) from the URL parameters.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Its sole responsibility is to instantiate the `LearningInterface` component, passing the `moduleId` and `lessonId` to it.
*   **Scalability & Reusability:**
    *   Standard Next.js dynamic page structure. Scalable for any number of modules and lessons.
    *   The main concern is the directory naming inconsistency mentioned above.

## Data Flow (Curriculum)

### `lib/curriculum.ts`

*   **Role:** This file now acts as the main aggregator for curriculum data. It imports individual module arrays from the `lib/curriculum/` directory (e.g., `module1.ts`, `module2.ts`) and exports a single, unified `curriculum` array that the application uses.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Read by `LearningInterface` to fetch the data for the current lesson.
    *   Serves as the central point for assembling the entire curriculum.
*   **Scalability & Reusability:**
    *   The modular structure (importing from `lib/curriculum/`) is much more scalable for managing a large curriculum. Adding or editing modules doesn't require modifying an increasingly large single file.
    *   `lib/curriculum/moduleX.ts`: Individual files within `lib/curriculum/` (e.g., `module1.ts`) define the actual lesson content for each module, exporting an array of lesson objects with a detailed structure. This promotes separation of concerns.

## General Architectural Notes

*   **Component-Based:** The application follows a standard React/Next.js component-based architecture.
*   **State Management:** Primary state for the learning interaction (`appliedClasses`, `currentInput`) is managed within `LearningInterface` and passed down or modified via callbacks. More complex global state (like overall user progress) is not yet implemented (see `considerations.md`).
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS is used for styling, with components in `components/ui/` likely providing pre-styled elements.
*   **Key Future Work (Scalability/Robustness):**
    *   Enhancing `LivePreview` for precise element targeting.
    *   Developing a robust validation engine for complex lessons.
    *   Improving curriculum data management for larger datasets.
    *   Implementing user progress tracking.
    *   These are further detailed in the `considerations.md` file.
