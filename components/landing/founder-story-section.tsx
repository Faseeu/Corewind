        Honestly, I stumbled into frontend as a{" "}
        <TextHighlighter highlightColor="hsl(200, 90%, 80%)" triggerType="inView">
          'vibe coder.'
        </TextHighlighter>{" "}
        I loved seeing things change on the screen, picking up a few Tailwind classes here and there. But when it came
        to building something specific, or fixing those stubborn layout errors?{" "}
        <TextHighlighter highlightColor="hsl(0, 90%, 80%)" triggerType="inView">
          I'd hit a wall.
        </TextHighlighter>{" "}
        The beautiful designs in my head just wouldn't translate to the screen.

        Learning Tailwind felt like a{" "}
        <TextHighlighter highlightColor="hsl(45, 90%, 80%)" triggerType="inView">
          maze.
        </TextHighlighter>{" "}
        Long courses I'd never finish, docs that were great but overwhelming for a deep dive, and constantly switching
        tabs to try things out... it just led to{" "}
        <TextHighlighter highlightColor="hsl(15, 90%, 80%)" triggerType="inView">
          more scrolling on social media instead.
        </TextHighlighter>{" "}
        That initial spark to <em>really learn</em> it started to fade.

    title: "The Meta-Learning Insight",
    content: (
      <>
        Frustrated but still curious, I started looking into <em>how</em> we actually learn complex skills effectively.
        One principle stood out again and again:{" "}
        <TextHighlighter highlightColor="hsl(280, 90%, 80%)" triggerType="inView">
          <strong>Active Recall & Deliberate Practice.</strong>
        </TextHighlighter>{" "}
        It's not just about consuming information, but actively <em>using</em> it, testing yourself, and getting
        immediate feedback. That's when real understanding sticks.

    title: "The 'Corewind' Spark",
    content: (
      <>
        Then one day, just idly thinking (probably avoiding actual coding!), the idea for Corewind surfaced. What if I
        could combine that active learning insight with everything I <em>wished</em> I had for Tailwind?{" "}
        <TextHighlighter highlightColor="hsl(120, 90%, 80%)" triggerType="inView">
          One place for focused, hands-on exercises.
        </TextHighlighter>{" "}
        Instant visual feedback. No more tab-switching chaos. A way to build up that 'muscle memory' for classes, almost
        like a game, making the important stuff stick without the grind.

        I started prototyping, pulling in tools and ideas, and was amazed.{" "}

          It <em>worked</em>.

        That feeling of 'getting it,' of classes just clicking into place, was incredible. Corewind became the tool I
        built first for myself. Now, I'm sharing it with you, hoping it makes your journey to mastering Tailwind CSS as
        clear, effective, and enjoyable as it should be.{" "}
